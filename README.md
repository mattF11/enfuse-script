# enfuse-script
Enfuse script used for image blending and focus stacking with opinionated defaults.
A script used to stack or blend images without learning multiple programs,you need to enter the image directory and select the action you want to perform,then wait for the result.

## dependancies
The script needs a couple of cli tools to work properly:
1. enblend-enfuse
2. dcraw
3. align_image_stack(you need to have hugin installed)

I personally use hugin only for panorama shots and bokeh panorama.
The script has become part of my personal editing tools,it's main objective is to be integrated with the dnglab_install-script into a complete tui/gui app.
