# enfuse-script
Enfuse script used for image blending and focus stacking with opinionated defaults.
A script used to stack or blend images without learning multiple programs,you need to enter the image directory and select the action you want to perform,then wait for the result.

## Dependancies
The script needs a couple of cli tools to work properly:
1. enblend-enfuse
2. dcraw
3. align_image_stack(you need to have hugin installed)

### Features
1. file coverter into .tiff format(dcraw)
2. image blending/stacking (enblend-enfuse)
3. align (align_image_stack)

I personally use hugin only for panorama shots,the script has become part of my personal editing tools, integration with the dnglab_install-script into a complete tui/gui app is one of the future iterations.
